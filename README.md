Short game submitted for evaluation as an assignment on the 7th of December, 2021. This package is meant to be imported and played utilizing Unity.

In this game, you control the triangular ship utilizing the virtual joystick and button provided in the game's interface. Hostile UFOs will spawn at the right side of the screen and travel towards the left, firing bullets at the player during regular intervals. The player has three hitpoints, and being struck thrice will respawn them at the center of the screen. Pushing the virtual button will trigger a powerful dash, which will destroy all enemies and their projectiles on screen, and set the dash on a cooldown period. The player ship will also fire bullets ahead automatically. There is no scoring system in this game.
